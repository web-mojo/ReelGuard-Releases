# ReelGuard Backup Checker Proprietary Licence Agreement

**Copyright © Web Mojo. All rights reserved.**

## 1. Definitions

In this Agreement:

**"Web Mojo"**, **"we"**, **"us"**, **"our"** means Michael Olscher trading as "Web Mojo", sole trader registered in Australia.

**"Software"** means the ReelGuard Backup Checker application (including any updates and related materials) supplied by Web Mojo.

**"You"**, **"your"** means the person or entity installing or using the Software.

**"ACL"** means the Australian Consumer Law in Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).

## 2. Grant of Licence

**2.1** Web Mojo grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to install and use the Software solely for your personal or internal business purposes, in accordance with this Agreement.

**2.2** This is a licence only. No title or ownership in the Software is transferred to you. No additional rights are granted except as expressly set out in this Agreement.

## 3. Free of Charge

**3.1** The Software is provided to you free of charge by Web Mojo. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts you pay to third parties (such as app stores, payment processors, hosting providers, or hardware vendors) are not payments to Web Mojo and do not create any additional obligations for Web Mojo.

**3.2** To the extent permitted by law, the fact the Software is provided free of charge is relevant to the allocation and limitation of risk agreed between you and Web Mojo in this Agreement.

## 4. Important Acknowledgements

You expressly acknowledge and agree that:

**4.1** No backups are performed. The Software is a checker only. It does not create, store, or maintain backups. You remain solely responsible for implementing and verifying your own backup procedures, redundancy, and integrity checks.

**4.2** No guarantee of detection. The Software may not detect all possible issues, errors, corruption, media failures, hardware faults, or mis-configurations. It is an aid, not a guarantee that any backup or copy is valid, complete, or usable.

**4.3** Your responsibility. You are solely responsible for:

- verifying any results produced by the Software;
- deciding whether the Software is suitable for your particular use case; and
- any actions you take or fail to take in reliance on the Software or its outputs.

**4.4** No professional advice. Any information, logs, reports, flags, or messages generated by the Software (or documentation or guidance provided with it) are general in nature and do not constitute professional, financial, legal, or engineering advice. You must not rely on them as a substitute for your own independent checks or professional advice.

## 5. Restrictions

You may not, and you must not permit any third party to:

**5.1** copy, modify, translate, adapt, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Software, except to the limited extent such activities are expressly permitted by applicable law and only after providing prior written notice to Web Mojo;

**5.2** publish, distribute, sublicense, sell, rent, lease, loan, or otherwise transfer the Software or any copy of it;

**5.3** remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, trade marks, or labels on the Software; or

**5.4** use the Software for any illegal purpose or in any manner that infringes the rights of any third party.

## 6. Ownership

**6.1** The Software and all related materials (including but not limited to code, documentation, logos, and designs) are owned by Web Mojo and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.

**6.2** This Agreement conveys no title, ownership, or other intellectual property rights in or to the Software, except for the limited licence granted in clause 2.

## 7. Updates and Third-Party Components

**7.1** Any updates, enhancements, or revisions to the Software that Web Mojo provides to you form part of the Software and are subject to this Agreement unless accompanied by a different licence.

**7.2** The Software may contain or rely on third-party components which are subject to separate open-source or third-party licences. You must comply with those licences to the extent they apply. Nothing in this Agreement limits your rights under such third-party licences.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties

**8.1** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

**8.2** Without limiting clause 8.1, Web Mojo makes no representation or warranty that the Software will:

- be error-free, uninterrupted, or free of defects, vulnerabilities, or incompatibilities;
- detect any or all backup issues, data corruption, file system errors, or hardware failures; or
- meet your particular requirements or achieve any specific result.

**8.3** All implied or statutory warranties, guarantees, terms, and conditions (including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement) are excluded to the maximum extent permitted by law.

**8.4** Australian Consumer Law. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to exclude, restrict, or modify any non-excludable consumer guarantees or rights you may have under the ACL or any other law that cannot lawfully be excluded. To the extent that any warranty, guarantee, or condition cannot be excluded but may be limited, it is limited as set out in clause 9.3.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

**9.1** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WEB MOJO AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF GOODWILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WEB MOJO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE.

**9.2** Without limiting clause 9.1, Web Mojo will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from:

**9.3** Where liability cannot be excluded but may be limited (including under the ACL), Web Mojo's total aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with the Software or this Agreement is, to the maximum extent permitted by law, limited at Web Mojo's option to:

- if the ACL applies and you are a consumer:
  - in the case of services – the resupply of the services or the cost of having the services supplied again; and
  - in the case of software or digital goods – the replacement of the software, the supply of equivalent software, or the payment of the cost of replacing the software or acquiring equivalent software;
- in all other cases (where permitted by law): the greater of
  - (a) the amount you paid to Web Mojo (if any) for the Software (which, for the standard free version, is typically AUD $0); or
  - (b) AUD $1.

**9.4** The limitations and exclusions in this clause 9 apply to the fullest extent permitted by law and survive any termination or expiry of this Agreement.
